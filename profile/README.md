<p>
	Hello, welcome to Lored! An organization, and personal project, founded by <a href="https://github.com/guz013">@Guz</a> to create resources, apps, templates, interfaces, libraries... to help other developers on their development and work process and experience. Everything here is open-source, 
	<i>most licensed on permissive licenses like MIT</i>, so feel free to use what we create on your projects and modify them to your needs!
</p>

<p><i>
	We are still a new and premature project with not a lot of experience, but we have a lot of ideas for the future. And what's the best way to
	learn something? Doing it!
</i></p>

<h3>From developers, to developers</h3>
