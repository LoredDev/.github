Hello, welcome to Lored! An organization, and personal project, founded by 
[@Guz](https://github.com/guz013) to create resources, apps, templates, interfaces, libraries... to 
help other developers on their development and work process and experience.

Everything here is open-source, *most licensed on permissive licenses like 
MIT*, so feel free to use what we create on your projects and modify them to 
your needs!

> We are still a new and premature project with not a lot of experience, 
> but we have a lot of ideas for the future. And what's the best way to 
> learn something? Doing it!
